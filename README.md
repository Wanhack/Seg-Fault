# Watchful-Wiggles

## A baby monitor project focused on efficient and inexpensive monitoring of infants without paying a hefty premium for a cloud-based off the shelf webcam monitor.
## We are motivated by the need for the market to provide an inexpensive monitor solution to new parents without breaking the bank or relying on sketchy cloud providers. 
## The project was prompted by competing in the HackUNT Hackathon, this branch of the project is a continuation which plans to trim the fat of the original project and be more of a consumer-focused and simple setup implementation.

## Installation

Requires a raspberry pi board of any level aside from raspberry pi 0. Current issues with libcamera library implementation caused roadblocks in the original project on pi0, so this branch will be configured for a higher-end board in mind.
For testing I will be using a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB model along with a adafruit IR camera for raspberry pi. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

My collaborators on the original hackathon project that I am branching from are listed here:
https://github.com/midnight145
Super cool dude who helped out a ton and learned to love the god-awful nosql database syntax to make our redis system work. Huge help and we couldn't have won without him. Did all the backend work.
https://github.com/wanhack
Another super cool dude. Our resident embedded systems and raspberry pi expert who found a way for us to continue after the aforementioned raspberry pi 0 headaches gave us a serious speedbump. Did all the hardware and raspberry pi work. 

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application.
