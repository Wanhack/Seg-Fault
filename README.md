# Watchful-Wiggles

## A baby monitor project focused on efficient and inexpensive monitoring of infants without paying a hefty premium for a cloud-based off the shelf webcam monitor.
## We are motivated by the need for the market to provide an inexpensive monitor solution to new parents without breaking the bank or relying on sketchy cloud providers. 
## The project was prompted by competing in the HackUNT Hackathon and is being entered for judging in multiple challenges such as:
    ## Respec: Automate my life. Find a creative and novel way to fully automate something in my (or your) daily life, so that it will save time and effort throughout the week.
          ## You may automate pretty much anything, so long as you can justify the time savings in my day/week. 
    ## GoDaddy: Best Domain Name from GoDaddy Registry.
    ## Redis Cloud: Show us how you‚Äôve used Redis Cloud in a way that showcases your unique and specific data structure needs.
    ## Streamlit: Hack with Streamlit this weekend. 
## In the development of this project we've learned how to use a lot of new project frameworks and tools and had lots of fun working with new people.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application.
